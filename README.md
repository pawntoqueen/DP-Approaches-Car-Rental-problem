Scenario of the Assignment:
Part-1
Assume that you are the owner of a car company. Your company has enough employees to
produce ‘p’ cars for each month. However, the number of the demand for the cars differs from
month to month. You should design a sales plan for the next ‘x’ months. Consider ‘i’ is the index
of each month (i=1,…,x) and m i is the demand for i th month. If your company needs to produce
more than ‘p’ cars for a month, you can hire some interns, paying ‘d’ TL per car for that month.
Moreover, if your company keeps any unsold car at the end the month, you should pay a
‘garage cost’. The garage cost will be calculated by the function G(j), where,
G(j) &lt; G(j+1) , j &gt; 0
G(j) &gt; 0
To understand the problem: Your current employees can produce p=5 cars in a month, for the
three month (x=3), m[ ] = { 7, 3, 6 } and G(1) = 5, G(2)= 7, G(3)=10, G(4)=12, G(5)=13, etc...
and d=5 TL.
For the first month, your employees can produce 5 cars, however, the demand is 7. You can
hire interns with the cost of d*(7-5) TL.
For the second month, the demand is 3, will you produce 5 and keep 2 cars in the garage for
the next months for not paying intern costs? Or will you just produce 3 cars?
Part-2
Besides, you must invest the payment that earned from your sales. Cost of each car is ‘B’ TL and
you get half of the price at the beginning of the month and the rest will be taken at the end of
the month. You have offers from ‘c’ different investment companies. Each investment company
offers different rate for each month. At the end of each month, you can change your

investment company by paying a taxes at a rate ‘t’ of your invested money or continue with the
same investment company without paying any taxes.
To understand the problem: Consider B=100 TL, c=3 -&gt; C 1 ={ 10, 8, 6 }, C 2 ={ 8, 10, 6 }, C 3 ={ 6, 8,
10 } and t is 2%.
For the first month, the demand was 7, so half of it is 7*100/2 = 350 TL. Your company can
invest 350 TL at the begining of 1 st month. For only one month, C 1 seems as the best option.
10% of 350 = 35 TL, at the end of the month, it will be 385 TL in total. Should you change C 1 with
C 2 or C 3 ?
Hint: Income at the end of 1 st month = the second half of 1 st month (350 TL) + the first half of 2 nd
month (3*100/2=150 TL) = 350 + 150 = 400 TL.
If you change the investment company you must pay 2% of 385, then add 400 on your money
for the second month. If you don’t change the company 385+400 will be invested in the same
invesment company.
You are expected to design a dynamic programming approach that minimizes the production
costs and maximizes the profit from invesments at the end of the ‘x’ months. In order to
evaluate the dynamic programming method, you are also expected to develop a greedy
approach for these plans.
Some variables are given in ‘month_demand.txt’ , ‘garage_cost.txt’ and ‘invesment.txt’ files.
The rest of variables (‘x’, ‘p’, ‘d’, ‘B’, ‘c’ and ‘t’) will be default at the beginning of the code as
shown in table-1.
You should print the difference between “total profit from invesments” (Part-2) and “the cost
comes from interns and garage costs” (Part-1) at the end of x th months.
You are expected to write a Scientific Report that explains completed and uncompleted parts of
your code. Your report should include comparison of run time complexity and space complexity
for both dynamic programming approach and greedy approach that you coded.
